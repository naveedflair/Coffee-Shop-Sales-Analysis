2. Objectives
•	Sales Trend Analysis: Examine sales data to identify patterns and trends over time, including daily, weekly, and monthly variations.
•	Product Performance: Assess the performance of different products to determine which items are the most and least popular.

3. Methodology
Data Collection:
•	The analysis was based on historical sales data provided by the coffee shop, including transaction details such as date, time, product type, and quantity sold.
Data Preprocessing:
•	Data cleaning was performed to remove any duplicates, correct errors, and handle missing values. The data was then formatted appropriately for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps were created to explore sales trends and product performance.
•	Descriptive statistics were used to summarize key metrics such as total sales, average sales per day, and product-wise sales distribution.

Product Performance Analysis:
•	Products were ranked based on total sales, and the top-performing items were identified.
•	Sales data was segmented by product category to understand which types of products contributed the most to overall sales.
Customer Behavior Analysis:
•	The analysis focused on identifying peak sales periods (e.g., time of day, day of the week) and understanding customer preferences.
•	Transaction data was examined to determine popular product pairings and combinations.

4. Challenges
Data Inconsistencies:
•	The sales data contained inconsistencies such as missing entries and duplicate records. These issues were addressed through data cleaning and validation procedures.
Seasonality Effects:
•	The presence of seasonality in sales trends made it challenging to generalize findings across different time periods. Additional analysis was conducted to isolate and understand these seasonal effects.
Data Granularity:
•	The level of detail in the sales data varied, making it difficult to perform certain types of analysis. For example, some transactions lacked time stamps, limiting the ability to analyze hourly sales trends.

5. Conclusion
Final Outcome:
•	The analysis provided valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. These findings can help the coffee shop make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and product offerings.

Recommendations:
•	Focus on stocking and promoting top-selling products, particularly during identified peak sales periods.
•	Consider introducing promotions or discounts on slower-moving items to boost their sales.
•	Use the insights from customer behavior analysis to tailor marketing campaigns and improve customer engagement.
Future Steps:
•	Conduct further analysis on seasonal sales patterns to optimize inventory and staffing during peak periods.
•	Explore additional data sources, such as customer feedback or loyalty program data, to gain deeper insights into customer preferences and satisfaction.
•	Implement a sales tracking system that captures more granular data, such as time-stamped transactions, to enhance future analysis.
